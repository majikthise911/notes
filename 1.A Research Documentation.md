# Polygon Documentation:

## Mint NFTs

https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/nftstorage/

- Polygon is a layer 2 scaling solution for ethereum and is chosen for its speed and lower transaction costs while maintaining full compataibility with Etthereum's EVM. This means that code can move freely between the two blockchains. There is also NFT.Storage which gives durability by using the underlying Filecoin network and immutability by using IPFS

In this tutorial we will aim to fulfill three characteristics with our minting process:

- Scalability of the minting process in terms of cost and throughput. If the use case aims to rapidly create NFTs, the underlying technology needs to handle all minting requests and the minting should be cheap.
- Durability of the NFT, as assets can be long-lived and therefore need to remain usable during their full lifetime.
- Immutability of the NFT and the asset it represents to prevent unwanted changes and malicious actors from changing the digital asset the NFT represents.

- I don't know what this is for 
this is alot of fun
